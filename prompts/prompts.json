An editorial board neither really knows nor cares about things like comps or departmental progress, all they want to know is if the person has specific expertise and can comment with a high degree of mastery on a certain topic. For most people that starts after a PhD, for many it will be in their masters or early PhD. Perhaps a few people would make it into a postdoc without having being asked. All depends on the quality, significance, general reputation of what their important (ie: well-regarded publication in a well-regarded journal) contributions have been. And, as in all things in this world, it's very field dependant, so this is going to vary a bit. The other thing is that there's a lot of publishing and not nearly enough qualified academics to do PR.

Throwaway for obvious reasons. I am currently working Post-PhD and have a good number of papers out (h-index >20). I am struggling with irrational feelings when it comes to the work of others, and I want to work on that. Some of this I potentially can attribute to some experiences during my Ph.D. that I will detail later. At its core, I am getting jealous of my co-workers for their success. If someone submits a paper and gets good reviews, I have a hard time feeling happy for them. On this note, I also have issues celebrating my own success. Whenever there is work that I think is subpar, I feel that they had it easy. This is particularly the case when I see people making quick studies, e.g., when the project and publication process runs smoothly. Whenever I see that a co-worker does solid work, I get envious and think why I didn\u2019t do this. I then have the feeling that they have found their niche, and I am sad that I don\u2019t have mine - although I probably, objectively have one. The absurd thing is that this is even the case when I am a co-author of a study - so even when I would benefit from my colleagues\u2019 success. From my Ph.D. I instilled some unhealthy \u201crules\u201d from a very ambitious PI. Some of them are obviously very questionable, but those are some of the first thoughts that come up in my mind and might help to rationalize what I am feeling: 1. You need to be the first or corresponding author of a study so that it has value. >> I guess this is why I don\u2019t value being \u201cjust\u201d a co-author on a paper. 2. The value of a paper is dependent on the journal. >> Before I see myself asking what the study is about, I rather think about the journal. 3. My Ph.D.-PI had very high standards and would become very nit-picky. >> e.g., when I find a typo, I devalue work disproportionally and assume the findings won\u2019t hold up. I get angry when I see published work that has questionable data quality 4. Once you finish a paper, directly move on to the next one. >> I have a hard time reflecting and celebrating success - or rather acknowledging success. I often talk my work down. I recently published a paper with very good reviews and then had nagging thoughts that others published in higher-impact journals. This often leads to the feeling that I am glad that it is over and not that I achieved something, as there is always something \"better\". 5. Metrics are everything. >> I check out people\u2019s track records on Google Scholar and compare myself and devalue people with fewer papers / lower citations.

				"response_0": "Ok, so my undergraduate and masters were both from Cambridge and I did an exchange at MIT so I may be able to help out somewhat. In a word, yes, they are pretty comparable. When you go to Cambridge you attend a college within the university. Each of these colleges competes to gain the highest number of'good degrees' each year and as such most of the teaching is done by the college itself. These take the form of supervisions (supos) which are often one on one, or one on three perhaps, in which you talk about a specific topic then submit an essay or work sheet every week. This means that for some subjects you are literally writing around 4,000 words per week. On top of this you have lectures (which not everyone attends) laid on by the university. Coupled with extra curricular work, sports and the like you really have very little time to do anything while in term time. That said, terms are short at only 8 weeks. It's quite a bit more work than MIT, but that said there is much more downtime outside of term, whereas at MIT there was time to have fun during the semester. Something else which is fairly unique is the way the degree works, the tripos. For some subjects you actually don't have any exams that count for anything until your third year. So you basically have to revise everything you have learnt for finals. This doesn't apply to everything though, some courses take account of every year. Supposedly engineers only need a first in one of the years of their tripos to quality (apparently), although for the Tompkins table I am fairly certain only 3rd and 2nd year results are used.",

				"context": "For those who have worked at both a CC and a research university, how did your experiences differ? And do you have any advice on someone who desires to do both? As a product of a community college and a research university, I've found myself dreaming of working at both. My closest connections with faculty happened at a community college; some of who I still talk to occasionally (6 years after transfer). They taught me the value of knowledge and part of me likes the idea of focusing on teaching the highly diverse CC population. When I was at university, I fell in love with my field. The process of deeply learning, asking questions, and participating as an RA in the research process was incredible. My dream of being an academic researcher really bloomed from these experiences. I received my undergrad degree in December 2016 and if the whole COVID situation taught me one thing, it's that I made a mistake leaving the academic space. Looking back, I was so lucky to have found a community and space of belonging at only 18. But I was afraid of the poor job prospects (I'm in anthro), how my social anxiety could swell in a front-facing people-oriented job, and I was terrified of not being good enough to go to grad school (so I never even tried applying). Unfortunately, my fear over these things has only increased with time but I figure I may as well try. Probably not until next year because my mind has really taken a beating with the events of 2020 and I haven't been able to sufficiently prep for this application cycle.

Unlike research institutions, or similar four-year institutions, faculty candidates are given higher marks for practical, \"real world\" experience, and the institution places value on skills one would gain from being in the workforce (relating to students, etc.). It's more the norm than the exception for full-time, community college faculty to have previously had non-academic careers, prior to entering academia. My recommendation? Focus on building your career, and let your real-world credentials eventually lead you into a community college teaching environment 5-7 years down the line.",
				"response_1": "I'm not at a community college, but I know someone that teaches in anthropology that suggested picking up 18 graduate hours in either psychology or sociology so you could teach in two social sciences and increase your usefulness at a CC. You are right to worry about jobs. I looked at my local CC and they had 13 full-time faculty in psychology, 5 in sociology, and 1 in anthropology. Even with the adjuncts they had listed, psychology had 34, sociology had 11, and anthropology had 1. I then looked at a smaller CC the next town over. They had 5 full time psychology faculty, 3 in sociology, and don't even offer anthropology.

An editorial board neither really knows nor cares about things like comps or departmental progress, all they want to know is if the person has specific expertise and can comment with a high degree of mastery on a certain topic. For most people that starts after a PhD, for many it will be in their masters or early PhD. Perhaps a few people would make it into a postdoc without having being asked. All depends on the quality, significance, general reputation of what their important (ie: well-regarded publication in a well-regarded journal) contributions have been. And, as in all things in this world, it's very field dependant, so this is going to vary a bit. The other thing is that there's a lot of publishing and not nearly enough qualified academics to do PR. This is actually a major crisis, and one of the many reasons why quality of publications have been really falling. Too many publications and not enough adjudicators.

				"context": "Jealousy in academia and how to deal with it Dear people of Reddit, It\u2019s time for me to get a reality check and hopefully some good advice from the hivemind. Throwaway for obvious reasons. I am currently working Post-PhD and have a good number of papers out (h-index >20). I am struggling with irrational feelings when it comes to the work of others, and I want to work on that. Some of this I potentially can attribute to some experiences during my Ph.D. that I will detail later. At its core, I am getting jealous of my co-workers for their success. If someone submits a paper and gets good reviews, I have a hard time feeling happy for them. On this note, I also have issues celebrating my own success. Whenever there is work that I think is subpar, I feel that they had it easy. This is particularly the case when I see people making quick studies, e.g., when the project and publication process runs smoothly. Whenever I see that a co-worker does solid work, I get envious and think why I didn\u2019t do this. I then have the feeling that they have found their niche, and I am sad that I don\u2019t have mine - although I probably, objectively have one. The absurd thing is that this is even the case when I am a co-author of a study - so even when I would benefit from my colleagues\u2019 success. From my Ph.D. I instilled some unhealthy \u201crules\u201d from a very ambitious PI. Some of them are obviously very questionable, but those are some of the first thoughts that come up in my mind and might help to rationalize what I am feeling: 1. You need to be the first or corresponding author of a study so that it has value. >> I guess this is why I don\u2019t value being \u201cjust\u201d a co-author on a paper. 2. The value of a paper is dependent on the journal. >> Before I see myself asking what the study is about, I rather think about the journal. 3. My Ph.D.-PI had very high standards and would become very nit-picky. >> e.g., when I find a typo, I devalue work disproportionally and assume the findings won\u2019t hold up. I get angry when I see published work that has questionable data quality 4. Once you finish a paper, directly move on to the next one. >> I have a hard time reflecting and celebrating success - or rather acknowledging success. I often talk my work down. I recently published a paper with very good reviews and then had nagging thoughts that others published in higher-impact journals. This often leads to the feeling that I am glad that it is over and not that I achieved something, as there is always something \"better\". 5. Metrics are everything. >> I check out people\u2019s track records on Google Scholar and compare myself and devalue people with fewer papers / lower citations.

When you go to Cambridge you attend a college within the university. Each of these colleges competes to gain the highest number of'good degrees' each year and as such most of the teaching is done by the college itself. These take the form of supervisions (supos) which are often one on one, or one on three perhaps, in which you talk about a specific topic then submit an essay or work sheet every week. This means that for some subjects you are literally writing around 4,000 words per week. On top of this you have lectures (which not everyone attends) laid on by the university. Coupled with extra curricular work, sports and the like you really have very little time to do anything while in term time. That said, terms are short at only 8 weeks. It's quite a bit more work than MIT, but that said there is much more downtime outside of term, whereas at MIT there was time to have fun during the semester. Something else which is fairly unique is the way the degree works, the tripos. For some subjects you actually don't have any exams that count for anything until your third year. So you basically have to revise everything you have learnt for finals. This doesn't apply to everything though, some courses take account of every year. Supposedly engineers only need a first in one of the years of their tripos to quality (apparently), although for the Tompkins table I am fairly certain only 3rd and 2nd year results are used.",
				"response_1": "8-week terms are so short that most students spend at least half of the \"month off\" you get at Christmas and Easter revising and consolidating what they were supposed to learn that term. It's a jam-packed 8 weeks. I'm not sure what the \"more time for reading before final exams\" is about, I don't think I ever had more than about ten days between lectures/projects finishing and exams starting, at Cambridge. Not a lot of time to revise a year's worth of work."

				"context": "For those who have worked at both a CC and a research university, how did your experiences differ? And do you have any advice on someone who desires to do both? As a product of a community college and a research university, I've found myself dreaming of working at both. My closest connections with faculty happened at a community college; some of who I still talk to occasionally (6 years after transfer). They taught me the value of knowledge and part of me likes the idea of focusing on teaching the highly diverse CC population. When I was at university, I fell in love with my field. The process of deeply learning, asking questions, and participating as an RA in the research process was incredible. My dream of being an academic researcher really bloomed from these experiences. I received my undergrad degree in December 2016 and if the whole COVID situation taught me one thing, it's that I made a mistake leaving the academic space. Looking back, I was so lucky to have found a community and space of belonging at only 18. But I was afraid of the poor job prospects (I'm in anthro), how my social anxiety could swell in a front-facing people-oriented job, and I was terrified of not being good enough to go to grad school (so I never even tried applying). Unfortunately, my fear over these things has only increased with time but I figure I may as well try. Probably not until next year because my mind has really taken a beating with the events of 2020 and I haven't been able to sufficiently prep for this application cycle. But as I'm pondering what path I want to take, I feel lost... If I choose to go the CC route, will getting a PhD make my job prospects better or worse?",
				"response_0": "The PhD will certainly help. IMO - aiming to teach at a two-year institution is the wisest path for someone interested in academia. Unlike research institutions, or similar four-year institutions, faculty candidates are given higher marks for practical, \"real world\" experience, and the institution places value on skills one would gain from being in the workforce (relating to students, etc.). It's more the norm than the exception for full-time, community college faculty to have previously had non-academic careers, prior to entering academia. My recommendation? Focus on building your career, and let your real-world credentials eventually lead you into a community college teaching environment 5-7 years down the line.",
				"response_1": "I'm not at a community college, but I know someone that teaches in anthropology that suggested picking up 18 graduate hours in either psychology or sociology so you could teach in two social sciences and increase your usefulness at a CC. You are right to worry about jobs. I looked at my local CC and they had 13 full-time faculty in psychology, 5 in sociology, and 1 in anthropology. Even with the adjuncts they had listed, psychology had 34, sociology had 11, and anthropology had 1. I then looked at a smaller CC the next town over. They had 5 full time psychology faculty, 3 in sociology, and don't even offer anthropology. At both schools, they each had a faculty member that was listed as dual in sociology and psychology which maybe gives a little credence to my friend's advice."

On the other hand, narrative theory, as suggested by philosophers like Paul Ricoeur and Marya Schechtman, argues that personal identity is real, but it is constructed through the stories we tell about ourselves. Our identities are shaped by our experiences, relationships, and cultural contexts. According to this view, personal identity is an ongoing process, where we actively create and revise our own self-narratives over time."

				"starter_context": "Jealousy in academia and how to deal with it Dear people of Reddit, It\u2019s time for me to get a reality check and hopefully some good advice from the hivemind. Throwaway for obvious reasons. I am currently working Post-PhD and have a good number of papers out (h-index >20). I am struggling with irrational feelings when it comes to the work of others, and I want to work on that. Some of this I potentially can attribute to some experiences during my Ph.D. that I will detail later. At its core, I am getting jealous of my co-workers for their success. If someone submits a paper and gets good reviews, I have a hard time feeling happy for them. On this note, I also have issues celebrating my own success. Whenever there is work that I think is subpar, I feel that they had it easy. This is particularly the case when I see people making quick studies, e.g., when the project and publication process runs smoothly. Whenever I see that a co-worker does solid work, I get envious and think why I didn\u2019t do this. I then have the feeling that they have found their niche, and I am sad that I don\u2019t have mine - although I probably, objectively have one. The absurd thing is that this is even the case when I am a co-author of a study - so even when I would benefit from my colleagues\u2019 success. From my Ph.D. I instilled some unhealthy \u201crules\u201d from a very ambitious PI. Some of them are obviously very questionable, but those are some of the first thoughts that come up in my mind and might help to rationalize what I am feeling: 1. You need to be the first or corresponding author of a study so that it has value. >> I guess this is why I don\u2019t value being \u201cjust\u201d a co-author on a paper. 2. The value of a paper is dependent on the journal. >> Before I see myself asking what the study is about, I rather think about the journal. 3. My Ph.D.-PI had very high standards and would become very nit-picky. >> e.g., when I find a typo, I devalue work disproportionally and assume the findings won\u2019t hold up. I get angry when I see published work that has questionable data quality 4. Once you finish a paper, directly move on to the next one. >> I have a hard time reflecting and celebrating success - or rather acknowledging success. I often talk my work down. I recently published a paper with very good reviews and then had nagging thoughts that others published in higher-impact journals. This often leads to the feeling that I am glad that it is over and not that I achieved something, as there is always something \"better\". 5. Metrics are everything. >> I check out people\u2019s track records on Google Scholar and compare myself and devalue people with fewer papers / lower citations. I get upset when they are further along the line. I am happy that I can share this here and would be looking forward to hearing perspectives or maybe strategies on how to work on this \u2014 or even telling me this is normal. Thanks a lot.",

Researchers need to possess a certain set of skills and qualifications, such as specialized knowledge in their field, the ability to think critically, and problem-solving skills. On the other hand, engineering positions require more technical skills and experience.

When you go to Cambridge you attend a college within the university.

These take the form of supervisions (supos) which are often one on one, or one on three perhaps, in which you talk about a specific topic then submit an essay or work sheet every week. This means that for some subjects you are literally writing around 4,000 words per week. On top of this you have lectures (which not everyone attends) laid on by the university. Coupled with extra curricular work, sports and the like you really have very little time to do anything while in term time. That said, terms are short at only 8 weeks. It's quite a bit more work than MIT, but that said there is much more downtime outside of term, whereas at MIT there was time to have fun during the semester. Something else which is fairly unique is the way the degree works, the tripos. For some subjects you actually don't have any exams that count for anything until your third year. So you basically have to revise everything you have learnt for finals. This doesn't apply to everything though, some courses take account of every year.

It may be beneficial to start with a part-time degree or research project and gradually transition into a full-time program or business. Furthermore, you should think about what your goals are and how the various paths can help you achieve them. Lastly, you may want to research into different programs and organizations that can provide the resources and support you need.",

				"followup_response0": "Understanding how to read a Turnitin report can be tricky, but it's important to be aware of how to properly interpret the score.

				"starter_context": "For those who have worked at both a CC and a research university, how did your experiences differ? And do you have any advice on someone who desires to do both? As a product of a community college and a research university, I've found myself dreaming of working at both. My closest connections with faculty happened at a community college; some of who I still talk to occasionally (6 years after transfer). They taught me the value of knowledge and part of me likes the idea of focusing on teaching the highly diverse CC population. When I was at university, I fell in love with my field. The process of deeply learning, asking questions, and participating as an RA in the research process was incredible. My dream of being an academic researcher really bloomed from these experiences. I received my undergrad degree in December 2016 and if the whole COVID situation taught me one thing, it's that I made a mistake leaving the academic space. Looking back, I was so lucky to have found a community and space of belonging at only 18. But I was afraid of the poor job prospects (I'm in anthro), how my social anxiety could swell in a front-facing people-oriented job, and I was terrified of not being good enough to go to grad school (so I never even tried applying). Unfortunately, my fear over these things has only increased with time but I figure I may as well try. Probably not until next year because my mind has really taken a beating with the events of 2020 and I haven't been able to sufficiently prep for this application cycle. But as I'm pondering what path I want to take, I feel lost... If I choose to go the CC route, will getting a PhD make my job prospects better or worse?",
				"starter_response0": "The PhD will certainly help. IMO - aiming to teach at a two-year institution is the wisest path for someone interested in academia. Unlike research institutions, or similar four-year institutions, faculty candidates are given higher marks for practical, \"real world\" experience, and the institution places value on skills one would gain from being in the workforce (relating to students, etc.). It's more the norm than the exception for full-time, community college faculty to have previously had non-academic careers, prior to entering academia. My recommendation? Focus on building your career, and let your real-world credentials eventually lead you into a community college teaching environment 5-7 years down the line.",
				"starter_response1": "I'm not at a community college, but I know someone that teaches in anthropology that suggested picking up 18 graduate hours in either psychology or sociology so you could teach in two social sciences and increase your usefulness at a CC.

Even with the adjuncts they had listed, psychology had 34, sociology had 11, and anthropology had 1. I then looked at a smaller CC the next town over. They had 5 full time psychology faculty, 3 in sociology, and don't even offer anthropology.

If you don't have a Ph.D. yet, I would recommend looking into other opportunities first, such as working in a research lab, publishing a research paper, or teaching as an adjunct professor at a community college. Working in a research lab can provide valuable practical experience in academic research, and teaching in a community college setting will give you valuable insights into the best practices for teaching college-level classes. Additionally, gaining experience in a research or teaching capacity can give you a better understanding of the kind of career path you want to pursue in academia. Once you've accumulated some experience, you can then apply to graduate school and begin building your academic career.",
				"followup_response1": "You should definitely consider attending grad school if you're interested in a career in academia. Going to grad school will give you the opportunity to focus on your studies, conduct research, and develop the skills you need to succeed in academia. There are a variety of grad school programs to choose from, so you should research each program thoroughly before making a decision.

On the other hand, narrative theory, as suggested by philosophers like Paul Ricoeur and Marya Schechtman, argues that personal identity is real, but it is constructed through the stories we tell about ourselves. Our identities are shaped by our experiences, relationships, and cultural contexts. According to this view, personal identity is an ongoing process, where we actively create and revise our own self-narratives over time."

For some reason, no one really ever discusses peer review, at least not in my immediate academic circles, so I'm just curious to hear others' experiences. I got my first peer review requests last year, around the time of my PhD defense. In the first year of my postdoc, I was getting requests maybe once a month on average.

				"starter_response1": "What I noticed that simply publishing didn't get me PR requests - it was once I started receiving regular citations that they started to come in. A trickle to begin, one or two a year perhaps. Then more. Then lots. That being said, I'd suppose it depends on where one is within their field rather than arbitrary markers in specific departments. An editorial board neither really knows nor cares about things like comps or departmental progress, all they want to know is if the person has specific expertise and can comment with a high degree of mastery on a certain topic. For most people that starts after a PhD, for many it will be in their masters or early PhD. Perhaps a few people would make it into a postdoc without having being asked. All depends on the quality, significance, general reputation of what their important (ie: well-regarded publication in a well-regarded journal) contributions have been. And, as in all things in this world, it's very field dependant, so this is going to vary a bit. The other thing is that there's a lot of publishing and not nearly enough qualified academics to do PR. This is actually a major crisis, and one of the many reasons why quality of publications have been really falling. Too many publications and not enough adjudicators. It also means the more junior folks are getting press ganged into service earlier. This is both a good and a bad thing.",

				"followup_response1": "It's normal to wonder why you are not getting asked to peer review as often as your peers. While the quality and significance of your contributions may play a role in the frequency of peer review requests, there may be other factors to consider as well. For instance, the current crisis in the field of academic publishing has led to a decrease in the number of peer reviews requested overall, as journals are struggling to stay afloat. Additionally, the limited number of journal editors may make it difficult for you to get noticed. Nevertheless, there are still a few steps you can take to make yourself more attractive to editors. Publishing regularly and being active in the academic community are great ways to get your name out there and increase your chances of getting noticed."

I want to go in an academic position (My PhD is in theoretical Statistics) but there are some causes for concern and confusion. I like a. Thinking thoroughly about a problem. b. Reading related literature. c. Discussing the problem with knowledgeable people. d. Finding interesting research problem and their effects in society. e. Serving some administrative roles. f. Collaboration with people from different disciplines I am neutral towards a. Teaching. I have extensive instructor experience. I don\u2019t particularly like teaching. I don\u2019t hate it. b.

I want to do research, but most people don\u2019t do research and make good money. I am perfectly content with a traditional job. I hate a. Publication pressure. Good research takes time and effort. I don\u2019t work well under pressure. b. Grant demands. It is not as bad in statistics, but I want to be researcher for working on interesting problems. Grant writing shouldn\u2019t be my main focus. c. Unpaid labour. If I am not paid in summer, I am not working for the uni in summer. No meetings, no administrative roles, not a single thing. My students can go do internships, I don\u2019t care. d. Research trends. I am against towards jumping for any hot buzzword. Pivoting research fields to something else takes years. Research is not fast fashion e. Deceit. Selling something for what it is not to garner interest/citation/research funds has become all too common in recent years. I understand why people do it, but I don\u2019t like it. TL;DR. I want to do research, preferably \u201cmyself\u201d (not primarily via mentoring).

				"starter_context": "Jealousy in academia and how to deal with it Dear people of Reddit, It\u2019s time for me to get a reality check and hopefully some good advice from the hivemind. Throwaway for obvious reasons. I am currently working Post-PhD and have a good number of papers out (h-index >20). I am struggling with irrational feelings when it comes to the work of others, and I want to work on that. Some of this I potentially can attribute to some experiences during my Ph.D. that I will detail later. At its core, I am getting jealous of my co-workers for their success. If someone submits a paper and gets good reviews, I have a hard time feeling happy for them. On this note, I also have issues celebrating my own success. Whenever there is work that I think is subpar, I feel that they had it easy. This is particularly the case when I see people making quick studies, e.g., when the project and publication process runs smoothly. Whenever I see that a co-worker does solid work, I get envious and think why I didn\u2019t do this. I then have the feeling that they have found their niche, and I am sad that I don\u2019t have mine - although I probably, objectively have one. The absurd thing is that this is even the case when I am a co-author of a study - so even when I would benefit from my colleagues\u2019 success. From my Ph.D. I instilled some unhealthy \u201crules\u201d from a very ambitious PI. Some of them are obviously very questionable, but those are some of the first thoughts that come up in my mind and might help to rationalize what I am feeling: 1. You need to be the first or corresponding author of a study so that it has value. >> I guess this is why I don\u2019t value being \u201cjust\u201d a co-author on a paper. 2. The value of a paper is dependent on the journal. >> Before I see myself asking what the study is about, I rather think about the journal. 3. My Ph.D.-PI had very high standards and would become very nit-picky. >> e.g., when I find a typo, I devalue work disproportionally and assume the findings won\u2019t hold up. I get angry when I see published work that has questionable data quality 4. Once you finish a paper, directly move on to the next one. >> I have a hard time reflecting and celebrating success - or rather acknowledging success. I often talk my work down. I recently published a paper with very good reviews and then had nagging thoughts that others published in higher-impact journals. This often leads to the feeling that I am glad that it is over and not that I achieved something, as there is always something \"better\". 5. Metrics are everything. >> I check out people\u2019s track records on Google Scholar and compare myself and devalue people with fewer papers / lower citations. I get upset when they are further along the line. I am happy that I can share this here and would be looking forward to hearing perspectives or maybe strategies on how to work on this \u2014 or even telling me this is normal. Thanks a lot.",

				"starter_response0": "Ok, so my undergraduate and masters were both from Cambridge and I did an exchange at MIT so I may be able to help out somewhat. In a word, yes, they are pretty comparable. When you go to Cambridge you attend a college within the university. Each of these colleges competes to gain the highest number of'good degrees' each year and as such most of the teaching is done by the college itself. These take the form of supervisions (supos) which are often one on one, or one on three perhaps, in which you talk about a specific topic then submit an essay or work sheet every week. This means that for some subjects you are literally writing around 4,000 words per week. On top of this you have lectures (which not everyone attends) laid on by the university. Coupled with extra curricular work, sports and the like you really have very little time to do anything while in term time. That said, terms are short at only 8 weeks. It's quite a bit more work than MIT, but that said there is much more downtime outside of term, whereas at MIT there was time to have fun during the semester. Something else which is fairly unique is the way the degree works, the tripos. For some subjects you actually don't have any exams that count for anything until your third year. So you basically have to revise everything you have learnt for finals. This doesn't apply to everything though, some courses take account of every year. Supposedly engineers only need a first in one of the years of their tripos to quality (apparently), although for the Tompkins table I am fairly certain only 3rd and 2nd year results are used.",
				"starter_response1": "8-week terms are so short that most students spend at least half of the \"month off\" you get at Christmas and Easter revising and consolidating what they were supposed to learn that term.

				"followup_response0": "The primary difference between US and Cambridge universities is the structure of their respective degrees. US universities typically offer a Bachelor of Arts (BA) or Bachelor of Science (BS), both of which typically involve completing a range of core courses and electives in order to graduate. The Cambridge degree, on the other hand, is a three-year undergraduate program focused on a single subject. It involves completing a series of courses in that specific subject, as well as exams, papers, and practicals. Cambridge degrees usually require more reading and research than US degrees, as well as a higher degree of independent learning.",
				"followup_response1": "The main difference between US and Cambridge universities is the workload. US universities tend to require a higher workload, with a greater focus on electives and independent research. Cambridge degrees, however, focus more on the core courses in your chosen subject, as well as exams, papers, and practicals. The Cambridge system also has a unique tradition of \"supervisions,\" in which students are closely guided by professors and tutors in their research and work. Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference and what type of learning experience you're looking for."

				"starter_context": "For those who have worked at both a CC and a research university, how did your experiences differ? And do you have any advice on someone who desires to do both? As a product of a community college and a research university, I've found myself dreaming of working at both. My closest connections with faculty happened at a community college; some of who I still talk to occasionally (6 years after transfer). They taught me the value of knowledge and part of me likes the idea of focusing on teaching the highly diverse CC population. When I was at university, I fell in love with my field. The process of deeply learning, asking questions, and participating as an RA in the research process was incredible. My dream of being an academic researcher really bloomed from these experiences. I received my undergrad degree in December 2016 and if the whole COVID situation taught me one thing, it's that I made a mistake leaving the academic space. Looking back, I was so lucky to have found a community and space of belonging at only 18. But I was afraid of the poor job prospects (I'm in anthro), how my social anxiety could swell in a front-facing people-oriented job, and I was terrified of not being good enough to go to grad school (so I never even tried applying). Unfortunately, my fear over these things has only increased with time but I figure I may as well try. Probably not until next year because my mind has really taken a beating with the events of 2020 and I haven't been able to sufficiently prep for this application cycle. But as I'm pondering what path I want to take, I feel lost... If I choose to go the CC route, will getting a PhD make my job prospects better or worse?",
				"starter_response0": "The PhD will certainly help. IMO - aiming to teach at a two-year institution is the wisest path for someone interested in academia. Unlike research institutions, or similar four-year institutions, faculty candidates are given higher marks for practical, \"real world\" experience, and the institution places value on skills one would gain from being in the workforce (relating to students, etc.). It's more the norm than the exception for full-time, community college faculty to have previously had non-academic careers, prior to entering academia. My recommendation? Focus on building your career, and let your real-world credentials eventually lead you into a community college teaching environment 5-7 years down the line.",
				"starter_response1": "I'm not at a community college, but I know someone that teaches in anthropology that suggested picking up 18 graduate hours in either psychology or sociology so you could teach in two social sciences and increase your usefulness at a CC.

Even with the adjuncts they had listed, psychology had 34, sociology had 11, and anthropology had 1. I then looked at a smaller CC the next town over. They had 5 full time psychology faculty, 3 in sociology, and don't even offer anthropology.

If you don't have a Ph.D. yet, I would recommend looking into other opportunities first, such as working in a research lab, publishing a research paper, or teaching as an adjunct professor at a community college. Working in a research lab can provide valuable practical experience in academic research, and teaching in a community college setting will give you valuable insights into the best practices for teaching college-level classes. Additionally, gaining experience in a research or teaching capacity can give you a better understanding of the kind of career path you want to pursue in academia. Once you've accumulated some experience, you can then apply to graduate school and begin building your academic career.",

				"followup_response0": "The students are protesting tuition hikes because it makes college unaffordable for many. With tuition going up, it becomes more difficult for students to pay for their education. Plus, the cost of living in California is high, so it's even harder for students to make ends meet.",
				"followup_response1": "I can understand why the students are on strike. I went to college in California a few years ago, and I had to take out a lot of student loans to pay for my tuition and living expenses. I know firsthand how hard it is to balance all of the expenses associated with college and make ends meet. These students are striking to draw attention to the financial struggles they face, and they want to ensure that they can receive an education without having to take on too much debt. It's a difficult situation, but I support them in their efforts."

One of the reviewers was adamant that four out of five of our figures were not mentioned in the main body of our manuscript text and appeared to come across angry about this in their summary (lol)... except they all were... many times! Perhaps the reviewer commented on our manuscript whilst half asleep, who knows! Slightly concerned our paper hasn't been reviewed properly but their other comments seem legit.

Respond with a lighthearted and polite comment - something like: \"I appreciate your attention to detail, but I think the 'aforementioned' word is a bit too fancy for this paper!\" In any case, don't let the reviewer's comments distract you from your original point. Stick to your original writing style and ignore the strange requests.",

Be courteous and respectful, but don't let their comment detract from the overall message of your paper. If the comment still doesn't make sense, you can contact the editor and ask for clarification. That way, you can make sure you address all the reviewer's comments and avoid any further delays in the review process."

My therapist has a background in my field, before they switched to psychology, and has been an amazing sounding board for some of my ideas over the past couple years. They've genuinely helped me to recontextualize some ideas and open up new doors I hadn't considered before in my research, and given some great advice on how to keep my enthusiasm for my topic going. That's on top of the more typical stuff like helping me to manage my impostor syndrome and ADHD. Basically I wouldn't even be in grad school without them and I'd like to be able to thank them in my MA thesis' acknowledgements section (once I finish the damn thing... getting there). Just by name alongside friends and colleagues, not necessarily giving details on who they are.

It can be difficult to know the best way to do this, but my advice would be to talk to your therapist about it. Ask them if they would be comfortable with being acknowledged publicly, and how they would prefer to be mentioned (e.g. by name, profession, etc.). They can help you figure out the best way to proceed.",
				"followup_response1": "It's natural to want to thank your therapist for their help. It's important to remember, however, that the relationship between a therapist and a client is very delicate. Consider the context and implications of your decision carefully. It's possible that publicly acknowledging your therapist may cause them to experience some discomfort, so it's best to proceed with caution. Before taking any action, make sure to have a discussion with your therapist and discuss the potential consequences of your decision."

It's important to remember that you don't have to do it alone. Seek out support from family, friends, and your local community. Additionally, do your research on the location of the program.

For example, a consequentialist might prioritize the benefit of relocating the remains, while a deontologist would be more concerned with adhering to social and cultural norms. We should also consider the cultural context; for instance, some cultures may view the relocation of a human corpse as a form of desecration, while others may accept it as a necessary part of certain funerary practices. Ultimately, the ethical judgment of this issue will depend on one's personal values, beliefs, and worldview. Here are some links to relevant studies that provide further insight into the philosophical and ethical considerations surrounding this topic: [LINK 1], [LINK 2], [LINK 3].",
				"followup_response1": "Yes, in some cases it is considered disrespectful to remove the remains of a human corpse from their burial ground. Respect for human corpses is an important part of many cultures, and the relocation of a corpse is often seen as an affront to their memory and legacy. However, there are some scenarios where the relocation of a human corpse may be permissible, such as when a cemetery is moved due to urbanization or the corpse is moved to a family plot. In these cases, it is important to proceed with utmost respect and consult with members of the community to ensure that their wishes are taken into account."

For some reason, no one really ever discusses peer review, at least not in my immediate academic circles, so I'm just curious to hear others' experiences.

A trickle to begin, one or two a year perhaps. Then more. Then lots. That being said, I'd suppose it depends on where one is within their field rather than arbitrary markers in specific departments. An editorial board neither really knows nor cares about things like comps or departmental progress, all they want to know is if the person has specific expertise and can comment with a high degree of mastery on a certain topic. For most people that starts after a PhD, for many it will be in their masters or early PhD. Perhaps a few people would make it into a postdoc without having being asked. All depends on the quality, significance, general reputation of what their important (ie: well-regarded publication in a well-regarded journal) contributions have been. And, as in all things in this world, it's very field dependant, so this is going to vary a bit. The other thing is that there's a lot of publishing and not nearly enough qualified academics to do PR. This is actually a major crisis, and one of the many reasons why quality of publications have been really falling. Too many publications and not enough adjudicators.

				"followup_response1": "It's normal to wonder why you are not getting asked to peer review as often as your peers. While the quality and significance of your contributions may play a role in the frequency of peer review requests, there may be other factors to consider as well. For instance, the current crisis in the field of academic publishing has led to a decrease in the number of peer reviews requested overall, as journals are struggling to stay afloat. Additionally, the limited number of journal editors may make it difficult for you to get noticed. Nevertheless, there are still a few steps you can take to make yourself more attractive to editors.

				"starter_context": "Jealousy in academia and how to deal with it Dear people of Reddit, It\u2019s time for me to get a reality check and hopefully some good advice from the hivemind. Throwaway for obvious reasons. I am currently working Post-PhD and have a good number of papers out (h-index >20). I am struggling with irrational feelings when it comes to the work of others, and I want to work on that. Some of this I potentially can attribute to some experiences during my Ph.D. that I will detail later. At its core, I am getting jealous of my co-workers for their success. If someone submits a paper and gets good reviews, I have a hard time feeling happy for them. On this note, I also have issues celebrating my own success. Whenever there is work that I think is subpar, I feel that they had it easy. This is particularly the case when I see people making quick studies, e.g., when the project and publication process runs smoothly. Whenever I see that a co-worker does solid work, I get envious and think why I didn\u2019t do this. I then have the feeling that they have found their niche, and I am sad that I don\u2019t have mine - although I probably, objectively have one. The absurd thing is that this is even the case when I am a co-author of a study - so even when I would benefit from my colleagues\u2019 success. From my Ph.D. I instilled some unhealthy \u201crules\u201d from a very ambitious PI. Some of them are obviously very questionable, but those are some of the first thoughts that come up in my mind and might help to rationalize what I am feeling: 1. You need to be the first or corresponding author of a study so that it has value. >> I guess this is why I don\u2019t value being \u201cjust\u201d a co-author on a paper. 2. The value of a paper is dependent on the journal. >> Before I see myself asking what the study is about, I rather think about the journal. 3. My Ph.D.-PI had very high standards and would become very nit-picky. >> e.g., when I find a typo, I devalue work disproportionally and assume the findings won\u2019t hold up. I get angry when I see published work that has questionable data quality 4. Once you finish a paper, directly move on to the next one. >> I have a hard time reflecting and celebrating success - or rather acknowledging success. I often talk my work down. I recently published a paper with very good reviews and then had nagging thoughts that others published in higher-impact journals. This often leads to the feeling that I am glad that it is over and not that I achieved something, as there is always something \"better\". 5. Metrics are everything. >> I check out people\u2019s track records on Google Scholar and compare myself and devalue people with fewer papers / lower citations. I get upset when they are further along the line. I am happy that I can share this here and would be looking forward to hearing perspectives or maybe strategies on how to work on this \u2014 or even telling me this is normal. Thanks a lot.",

Research scholars or researchers put in more hours and accumulate greater experience. However, when it comes to wages, they are paid very low when compared to computer science graduates straight out of college. Can you explain this asymmetry?",
				"starter_response0": "Likely no one specific reason. However, in my opinion, a big factor is that said graduates are working at a business which produces goods that people pay money for. That is not often the case for researchers. For example, the goods researchers produce are often free for others (e.g., open source software, so that uptake is greater), or aren't fundamentally made to turn a profit (e.g., a paper).",
				"starter_response1": "Despite what people like to think, nobody is paid based on how smart they are or how much work they put in. They are paid based on 2 things: - The amount of money they make for the person paying them - The amount it costs to replace them (demand vs supply) When academics produce very little that makes money, and are easily replaced due to the massive supply of other PhDs pining after the academic jobs with no self-respect, willing to be paid the bare minimum to survive, they will be paid very little.",

				"followup_response0": "The wages for researchers are lower than engineers because research positions require more specialized skills and knowledge, and the competition for these jobs is much higher. There are just not as many research positions as engineering jobs, so researchers have to settle for lower wages.",
				"followup_response1": "The wage gap between researchers and engineers can be attributed to two main factors: the level of skills required for the job and the supply and demand of the position. Researchers need to possess a certain set of skills and qualifications, such as specialized knowledge in their field, the ability to think critically, and problem-solving skills. On the other hand, engineering positions require more technical skills and experience. In terms of supply and demand, there are fewer research positions than engineering jobs, and the competition for these positions is higher. This drives down wages as more people compete for the same jobs. Ultimately, the wage gap between researchers and engineers depends on the specific job market and the qualifications of the applicants."

				"starter_response0": "Ok, so my undergraduate and masters were both from Cambridge and I did an exchange at MIT so I may be able to help out somewhat. In a word, yes, they are pretty comparable. When you go to Cambridge you attend a college within the university. Each of these colleges competes to gain the highest number of'good degrees' each year and as such most of the teaching is done by the college itself. These take the form of supervisions (supos) which are often one on one, or one on three perhaps, in which you talk about a specific topic then submit an essay or work sheet every week. This means that for some subjects you are literally writing around 4,000 words per week. On top of this you have lectures (which not everyone attends) laid on by the university. Coupled with extra curricular work, sports and the like you really have very little time to do anything while in term time. That said, terms are short at only 8 weeks. It's quite a bit more work than MIT, but that said there is much more downtime outside of term, whereas at MIT there was time to have fun during the semester. Something else which is fairly unique is the way the degree works, the tripos. For some subjects you actually don't have any exams that count for anything until your third year. So you basically have to revise everything you have learnt for finals. This doesn't apply to everything though, some courses take account of every year. Supposedly engineers only need a first in one of the years of their tripos to quality (apparently), although for the Tompkins table I am fairly certain only 3rd and 2nd year results are used.",

US universities typically offer a Bachelor of Arts (BA) or Bachelor of Science (BS), both of which typically involve completing a range of core courses and electives in order to graduate. The Cambridge degree, on the other hand, is a three-year undergraduate program focused on a single subject. It involves completing a series of courses in that specific subject, as well as exams, papers, and practicals. Cambridge degrees usually require more reading and research than US degrees, as well as a higher degree of independent learning.",

US universities tend to require a higher workload, with a greater focus on electives and independent research. Cambridge degrees, however, focus more on the core courses in your chosen subject, as well as exams, papers, and practicals. The Cambridge system also has a unique tradition of \"supervisions,\" in which students are closely guided by professors and tutors in their research and work.

As a product of a community college and a research university, I've found myself dreaming of working at both. My closest connections with faculty happened at a community college; some of who I still talk to occasionally (6 years after transfer). They taught me the value of knowledge and part of me likes the idea of focusing on teaching the highly diverse CC population. When I was at university, I fell in love with my field. The process of deeply learning, asking questions, and participating as an RA in the research process was incredible. My dream of being an academic researcher really bloomed from these experiences. I received my undergrad degree in December 2016 and if the whole COVID situation taught me one thing, it's that I made a mistake leaving the academic space. Looking back, I was so lucky to have found a community and space of belonging at only 18. But I was afraid of the poor job prospects (I'm in anthro), how my social anxiety could swell in a front-facing people-oriented job, and I was terrified of not being good enough to go to grad school (so I never even tried applying). Unfortunately, my fear over these things has only increased with time but I figure I may as well try. Probably not until next year because my mind has really taken a beating with the events of 2020 and I haven't been able to sufficiently prep for this application cycle.

It's more the norm than the exception for full-time, community college faculty to have previously had non-academic careers, prior to entering academia. My recommendation?

All depends on the quality, significance, general reputation of what their important (ie: well-regarded publication in a well-regarded journal) contributions have been. And, as in all things in this world, it's very field dependant, so this is going to vary a bit. The other thing is that there's a lot of publishing and not nearly enough qualified academics to do PR.

				"starter_context": "Jealousy in academia and how to deal with it Dear people of Reddit, It\u2019s time for me to get a reality check and hopefully some good advice from the hivemind. Throwaway for obvious reasons. I am currently working Post-PhD and have a good number of papers out (h-index >20). I am struggling with irrational feelings when it comes to the work of others, and I want to work on that. Some of this I potentially can attribute to some experiences during my Ph.D. that I will detail later. At its core, I am getting jealous of my co-workers for their success. If someone submits a paper and gets good reviews, I have a hard time feeling happy for them. On this note, I also have issues celebrating my own success. Whenever there is work that I think is subpar, I feel that they had it easy. This is particularly the case when I see people making quick studies, e.g., when the project and publication process runs smoothly. Whenever I see that a co-worker does solid work, I get envious and think why I didn\u2019t do this. I then have the feeling that they have found their niche, and I am sad that I don\u2019t have mine - although I probably, objectively have one. The absurd thing is that this is even the case when I am a co-author of a study - so even when I would benefit from my colleagues\u2019 success. From my Ph.D. I instilled some unhealthy \u201crules\u201d from a very ambitious PI. Some of them are obviously very questionable, but those are some of the first thoughts that come up in my mind and might help to rationalize what I am feeling: 1. You need to be the first or corresponding author of a study so that it has value. >> I guess this is why I don\u2019t value being \u201cjust\u201d a co-author on a paper. 2. The value of a paper is dependent on the journal. >> Before I see myself asking what the study is about, I rather think about the journal. 3. My Ph.D.-PI had very high standards and would become very nit-picky. >> e.g., when I find a typo, I devalue work disproportionally and assume the findings won\u2019t hold up. I get angry when I see published work that has questionable data quality 4. Once you finish a paper, directly move on to the next one. >> I have a hard time reflecting and celebrating success - or rather acknowledging success. I often talk my work down. I recently published a paper with very good reviews and then had nagging thoughts that others published in higher-impact journals. This often leads to the feeling that I am glad that it is over and not that I achieved something, as there is always something \"better\". 5. Metrics are everything. >> I check out people\u2019s track records on Google Scholar and compare myself and devalue people with fewer papers / lower citations.

				"followup_response0": "The wages for researchers are lower than engineers because research positions require more specialized skills and knowledge, and the competition for these jobs is much higher. There are just not as many research positions as engineering jobs, so researchers have to settle for lower wages.",
				"followup_response1": "The wage gap between researchers and engineers can be attributed to two main factors: the level of skills required for the job and the supply and demand of the position. Researchers need to possess a certain set of skills and qualifications, such as specialized knowledge in their field, the ability to think critically, and problem-solving skills. On the other hand, engineering positions require more technical skills and experience. In terms of supply and demand, there are fewer research positions than engineering jobs, and the competition for these positions is higher.

				"starter_response0": "Ok, so my undergraduate and masters were both from Cambridge and I did an exchange at MIT so I may be able to help out somewhat. In a word, yes, they are pretty comparable. When you go to Cambridge you attend a college within the university. Each of these colleges competes to gain the highest number of'good degrees' each year and as such most of the teaching is done by the college itself. These take the form of supervisions (supos) which are often one on one, or one on three perhaps, in which you talk about a specific topic then submit an essay or work sheet every week. This means that for some subjects you are literally writing around 4,000 words per week. On top of this you have lectures (which not everyone attends) laid on by the university. Coupled with extra curricular work, sports and the like you really have very little time to do anything while in term time. That said, terms are short at only 8 weeks. It's quite a bit more work than MIT, but that said there is much more downtime outside of term, whereas at MIT there was time to have fun during the semester. Something else which is fairly unique is the way the degree works, the tripos. For some subjects you actually don't have any exams that count for anything until your third year. So you basically have to revise everything you have learnt for finals. This doesn't apply to everything though, some courses take account of every year. Supposedly engineers only need a first in one of the years of their tripos to quality (apparently), although for the Tompkins table I am fairly certain only 3rd and 2nd year results are used.",

US universities typically offer a Bachelor of Arts (BA) or Bachelor of Science (BS), both of which typically involve completing a range of core courses and electives in order to graduate. The Cambridge degree, on the other hand, is a three-year undergraduate program focused on a single subject. It involves completing a series of courses in that specific subject, as well as exams, papers, and practicals. Cambridge degrees usually require more reading and research than US degrees, as well as a higher degree of independent learning.",

US universities tend to require a higher workload, with a greater focus on electives and independent research. Cambridge degrees, however, focus more on the core courses in your chosen subject, as well as exams, papers, and practicals.

As a product of a community college and a research university, I've found myself dreaming of working at both. My closest connections with faculty happened at a community college; some of who I still talk to occasionally (6 years after transfer). They taught me the value of knowledge and part of me likes the idea of focusing on teaching the highly diverse CC population. When I was at university, I fell in love with my field. The process of deeply learning, asking questions, and participating as an RA in the research process was incredible. My dream of being an academic researcher really bloomed from these experiences. I received my undergrad degree in December 2016 and if the whole COVID situation taught me one thing, it's that I made a mistake leaving the academic space. Looking back, I was so lucky to have found a community and space of belonging at only 18. But I was afraid of the poor job prospects (I'm in anthro), how my social anxiety could swell in a front-facing people-oriented job, and I was terrified of not being good enough to go to grad school (so I never even tried applying). Unfortunately, my fear over these things has only increased with time but I figure I may as well try. Probably not until next year because my mind has really taken a beating with the events of 2020 and I haven't been able to sufficiently prep for this application cycle.

There are a variety of grad school programs to choose from, so you should research each program thoroughly before making a decision. Additionally, you can look into getting an internship or volunteering in an academic setting to gain experience and get a better understanding of what it's like to work in academia. Good luck!"

				"starter_context": "Academics and professionals, to stay current in your field, how much reading do you do? How many peer reviewed papers would you estimate you read, how many books do you read? Other questions along these lines. * Do you find journals or books are better sources of information, or some other source? * What are the advantages and disadvantages of both and do you use different sources for different types of learning? * Does reddit/other internet sites help in getting an appropriate understanding or at least awareness of a topic?",
				"starter_response0": "Try signing up for RSS feeds for your field's journals. I have the Feedly app on my phone and scroll through it while on the bus, waiting, etc. I save the articles that sound relevant, and read them later when I have more time (e.g., at night before bed, weekends, etc). EDIT: Oh, and to answer your questions more specifically, I usually at least skim abstracts of at least 20 papers per week, all from journals online. The only time I use a book from the library is when I'm compiling sources for a review paper or something. I also follow a couple organizations specific to my field on Facebook, and they post links to interesting articles.",
				"starter_response1": "Between new publications, looking for information, and looking for data I skim a lot of papers, but don't read many of them in-depth. Books are mostly useful in getting started in a newer area (start of a PhD, or when changing topics), not so much otherwise.",

				"starter_reason": "Candidate Response 1 is more helpful because it provides specific advice on how to stay current in one's field (e.g., using RSS feeds, skimming abstracts, and following organizations on Facebook). It also answers the other questions posed in the context, such as the advantages and disadvantages of different sources of information and the usefulness of Reddit and other internet sites.",
				"followup_context": "I'm an academic researcher who is interested in staying current on the latest developments in my field. What are some good ways to keep track of all the recent publications, conferences, and other research news? Any advice would be much appreciated!",
				"followup_response0": "Keeping up with research news can be a difficult task, especially in the age of digital overload! Here are some useful tips: Set up RSS feeds for academic journals related to your research, so that you can stay up to date on new articles and developments. Skim through abstracts of research articles to quickly gain an understanding of what has been published. Follow relevant organizations on social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, for news about upcoming events, research conferences, and other announcements. Additionally, sites like Reddit may also be helpful for keeping track of the latest news and discussions related to your field.",
				"followup_response1": "I recommend networking with professionals and other researchers in your field. This can help you gain exposure to interesting research topics, stay informed about new developments, and have discussions with other experts in your field. Additionally, sites like ResearchGate and LinkedIn can be great resources to find people who are knowledgeable in the same area as you. Joining online communities related to your research can also be a great way to stay connected and learn about new discoveries."
